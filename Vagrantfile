  #   vb.gui = true
      vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--nested-hw-virt", "on"]

  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
